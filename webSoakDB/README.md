# webSoakDB
Created using cookiecutter template: https://github.com/xchem/cookiecutter-xchem-stack/

webSoakDB_backend, webSoakDB_frontend and webSoakDB apps come from the template and have hardly been modified.

API app was added to the template, with endpoinds for the future Compound Selection app.

data_dump.json provides some test data taken from my local version of xchem-soakdb-2; can be loaded using:
`python manage.py loaddata`

temp_code_storage contains some draft code to be deleted later when I find the proper place for it

TODO: installation instructions
